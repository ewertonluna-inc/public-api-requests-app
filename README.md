- Modal toggle
    Added this feature so the user can toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open.
- Structre, style and CSS:
    When the end user clicks on the first employee (top right) and the modal window pops up,the previous button is styled to have a lower opacity so the user knows that clicking on it won't do anything. The same goes for clicking on the last employee on the page (bottom left).
