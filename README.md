 Public API Requests

Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself.

This project uses the Random Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random employees and uses that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

Extra Features Added(Extra Credit)
- Search:
    Search box to filter the directory by name.
- Modal toggle:
    This feature is added so the user can toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open.
- Structre, style and CSS:
    When the end user clicks on the first employee (top right) and the modal window pops up,the previous button is styled to have a lower opacity so the user knows that clicking on it won't do anything. The same goes for clicking on the last employee on the page (bottom left).
